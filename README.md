This set of dot- and rc files mostly defines my shell working
environment (mostly Mac, also used on a Linux box).

Main applications:
 * Emacs (through prelude)
 * ZSH (oh-my-zsh)
 * Git
 * tmux

Notable mentions:
 * keysnail (Emacs for the browser)
 * slate (Mac window operations on a keyboard)
 * rmc (link dotfiles conveniently)
 * osx (setup sane development defaults on OS X)
 * Emacs keybindings for most of OS X (through Library/KeyBindings)
