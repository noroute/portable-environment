This set of dot- and rc files mostly defines my shell working
environment (mostly Mac, also used on a Linux box).

Main applications:
 * Emacs24 (through [prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude/))
 * zsh ([oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
 * git
 * tmux

Notable mentions:
 * [keysnail](https://github.com/mooz/keysnail) (Emacs for the browser)
 * [slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) (do everything to windows on Mac using only a keyboard)
 * [rmc](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) (dotfile management)
 * osx (setup sane development defaults on OS X)
 * Emacs keybindings for most of OS X (through Library/KeyBindings)
